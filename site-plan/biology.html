            <h2>Replication</h2>
            <p>Replication is the process by which a cell duplicates its DNA, ensuring that each daughter cell receives an identical copy of the genetic material. This occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle, involving the unwinding of the double helix by helicase enzymes, followed by the synthesis of a new complementary strand by DNA polymerase. The process is semi-conservative, meaning that each new DNA molecule consists of one original strand and one newly synthesized strand, thereby preserving the genetic information across generations.</p>
            <h2>Transcription</h2>
            <p>Transcription is the process by which the information encoded in a DNA sequence is copied into messenger RNA (mRNA). During transcription, RNA polymerase binds to the promoter region of a gene and unwinds a small section of the DNA helix. It then synthesizes a single-stranded RNA molecule using one of the DNA strands as a template. This RNA strand, which is complementary to the DNA template strand, carries the genetic information needed for protein synthesis. Transcription proceeds through three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. The resulting mRNA strand undergoes processing, including splicing, capping, and polyadenylation, before it is transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm.</p>
            <h2>Translation</h2>
            <p>Translation is the process by which the sequence of an mRNA molecule is decoded to produce a specific polypeptide, or protein. This process occurs in the cytoplasm, where ribosomes, composed of rRNA and proteins, facilitate the assembly of amino acids into polypeptide chains. The ribosome reads the mRNA sequence in sets of three nucleotides, known as codons, each of which specifies a particular amino acid. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid, recognize and bind to their complementary codons on the mRNA through their anticodons. The ribosome catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds between the amino acids, creating a growing polypeptide chain. Translation proceeds through three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination, ultimately resulting in the synthesis of a protein that will fold into its functional three-dimensional structure.</p>
            <h2>Integration of Replication, Transcription, and Translation</h2>
            <p>Together, replication, transcription, and translation constitute the core mechanisms by which genetic information is faithfully transmitted, expressed, and utilized within a cell. These processes ensure the continuity of genetic information, the production of RNA molecules necessary for cellular function, and the synthesis of proteins that carry out a vast array of cellular activities. Understanding these mechanisms provides insight into the fundamental principles of biology and the intricate molecular choreography that sustains life.</p>
