                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hey kids, it's Ya Pops: AKA Elias Woodbury. I am currently a student at BYUI majoring in computer science with an emphasis in machine learning (Artificial Intelligence). While I am studying computer science, my plan is to go to Dental School and hopefully specialize in Oral Surgery. Because of that, I have taken many Biology and Chemistry classes and saw an opportunity to hone my skills while offering some help and resources to those who come after me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise." (John 5:19)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have grown more grateful for those who came before me and turned back to teach me. I consider them forefathers of my success. I only hope that, like them, I can offer help to those who come next. Everything here is free. If you need help or know someone who does, schedule a tutoring appointment through BYUI in the link below. And don't forget to tell 'em you learned it from Ya Pops!
