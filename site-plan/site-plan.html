      <h3>Home</h3>
      <h4>
        Nav Bar
      </h4>
      <p>
         Here I will have my navigation bar located. My navigation bar will have two other pages with their own submenus. 
      </p> 
      <h4>
        Logo
      </h4>
        <p>
          I want my logo and slogan displayed big and my nav menu already opened when the user gets to the screen. 
        </p>
        <h4>
          Images
        </h4>
        <p>
          I want to display at least three images on my homepage. On my home website, I will have an image of myself and a small biography and credentials to help those I tutor trust me more and leave them with peace that they are in good hands with my help. I also want it to be clear that there are many helpful resources, information, and tips to perform well in their own chemistry and biology classes. The other two will be card links to my other pages that when clicked on will navigate to them.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Submenus
        </h4>
        <p>
          I plan on giving a small submenu of topics that Users can click on, and that will take them to the exact place on the other pages where they wish to navigate. This will allow my users to navigate the website efficiently. This is a website for my personal use to hold my content for tutoring in Biology and Chemistry. That means that I want to be able to navigate quickly through my own information and allow easy and eye appealing navigation to those who I tutor.

Also within the document, I want to have images, tips and tricks and help links for tools that I found helpful during my time in Chem 105. I also want to have my filled out teaching sheets available for others to use and see and learn from. I would repeat this process for Chem 106.

        Below, I want to have a calendar that I can edit, so I can input and others can see the times that I’m going to tutor each week. I want to make it very easy to access and utilize. I’m thinking I could use a third party and a little java script to do this.
